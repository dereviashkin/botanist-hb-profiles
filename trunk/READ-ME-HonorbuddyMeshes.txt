
If you need mesh files, you can get them from my mesh svn at https://botanist-hb-meshes.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

These are the Honorbuddy meshes currently on my computer.
They are up-to-date as of the last time I ran the bot in all the different the zones.
To use these meshes, click the Settings and Tools button in Honorbuddy.
Change the Mesh directory in Honorbudyy to the botanist-hb-meshes folder.
In the Mesh section on the top right of the Tools & Settings window, click the change button and browse to \botanist-hb-profiles\HonorbuddyMeshes and set it as your mesh directory.
Close and restart Honorbuddy.

******Alternate method******
Close Honorbuddy
Copy all the files in the botanist-hb-meshes folder.
Browse to where your meshes are stored. By default C:\Users\Your User Account Name\AppData\Local\HonorbuddyMeshes
Paste the copied meshes into the HonorbuddyMeshes folder.
Overwrite any existing meshes you currently have.
Restart Honorbuddy.

You will now have a lot of meshes, but more than likely not all.
