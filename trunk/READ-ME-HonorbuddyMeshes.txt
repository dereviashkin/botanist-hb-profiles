
If you need mesh files, you can get them from my mesh svn at https://botanist-hb-meshes.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

These are the Honorbuddy meshes currently on my computer.
They are up-to-date as of the last time I ran the bot in all the different zones.
To use these meshes, click the Settings and Tools button in Honorbuddy.
In the Mesh section on the top right of the Tools & Settings window, click the change button and browse to \botanist-hb-meshes and set it as your mesh directory.
Close and restart Honorbuddy.

******Alternate method******
Close Honorbuddy
Copy all the files in the botanist-hb-meshes folder.
Browse to where your meshes are stored. By default C:\Users\Your User Account Name\AppData\Local\HonorbuddyMeshes
Paste the copied meshes into the HonorbuddyMeshes folder.
Overwrite any existing meshes you currently have.
Restart Honorbuddy.

You will now have a lot of meshes, but more than likely not all.
