As some of you have already figured out, I received a 7 day ban today from the forumns.
And then the mods decided it best to close my profile page until my ban is lifted on 10/27/12 
because people were commenting on it and causing a problem as I was told.

Anyhow, I will continue to work on my profiles and update them via svn. Back to the forums in a week.
