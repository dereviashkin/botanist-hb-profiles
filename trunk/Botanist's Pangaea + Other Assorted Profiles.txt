[QUOTE] [SIZE=3][COLOR="#008000"]Pangaea is an Alliance/Horde 1-90 100% AFKable profile. Starts in [COLOR="#0000CD"][SIZE=4][U]Northshire[/U] (Alliance)[/SIZE][/COLOR] or [COLOR="#FF0000"][SIZE=4][U]Valley of Trials[/U] (Horde)[/SIZE][/COLOR], ends at the Temple of the White Tiger. (Waits for assistance to complete the quest opening the gate to Vale of the Eternal Blossoms) Zone locked races can use this after leaving the starting zone. Pangaea is fully automated (sets hearth, uses hearth,  repairs, mails, vendors, uses boats/portals/flight paths, completes opening quest for Hyjal and Pandaria). Pangaea currently interchanges between 22 profiles as needed. The profile is made to work in conjunction with [URL="http://www.thebuddyforum.com/releases/30506-arelog-simple-free-relogger-buddy-products.html"][COLOR="#800000"]Arelog[/COLOR][/URL] (Arelog is not a requirement). Set Arelog to run this profile on your character(s) for approximately 6-8 hours per day and to Idle for 16-18 hours per day and forget about it. Come back in two weeks to your new level 90 character.[/COLOR] [/SIZE][/QUOTE]

[QUOTE][B][COLOR="#0000FF"][SIZE=3]What It Does:[/SIZE][/COLOR][/B]

[SIZE=3][COLOR="#008000"]Pangaea is a leveling profile that detects your faction/ level and automatically changes to the appropriate profile for your character. It is essentially a fancy griding profile written on the "Questing" bot base to allow much more functionality than a "Grinding" bot base profile. It does complete some quest, approximately (15) but, only the quest reqired for it to navigate in wow by opening portal or gates such as those leading into Vale of Eternal Blossoms .[/COLOR][/SIZE]  [/QUOTE]

1. The profile will require a total of 1005 gold for riding training.

All or the majority of riding cost will looted by your character.
2. Use the Autoeqip plugin for Honorbuddy to equip looted gear. The better your characters gear, the faster it will  level. If possible, periodically purchase level appropriate gear, but it is not a requirement.
