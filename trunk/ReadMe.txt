On October 27th 2014, Hawker (co-owner) of Honorbuddy messaged me via skype and accused me of allegedly 

being an accessory to the theft of HonorBuddy Store Products and providing them to CodeDeception.

All those that know me know I am not a real coder or hacker. 

I write .xml; a kindergarten "non" programming language.

Such an accusation is absolutely ridiculous !!!

As a result of such backstabbing after 5 years of supporting HB, 

I will no longer support HonorBuddy (as a company). 

I will continue to update my donor SVN and all the profiles it contains. 

All new products will be released via my donor SVN or my website.
