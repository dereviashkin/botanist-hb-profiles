I have donated 1000's of hours of my time to make profiles for the public HB users.
During the entire time, 4 people have donated a total of $15 and BotOperator donated a MOP cd key.
Until I decide to charge for profiles, which isn't likely to happen. I have removed all my profiles.
If you are one of the people that donated, feel free to message me via the HB forums or my email at 
botanist1968@gmail.com and I will make the profiles available for you as well as future profiles.
Be sure to include the name which you donated from. If your name isn't on the donation list, the profiles will
not be available unless you donate. The amount of the donation isn't important.I am not going to waste countless 
hours writing code for ungrateful people who feel they are entitled to my work simply because they purchased HB. 
I don't work for HB, nor do any of the other profile or CC devs.

I will continue the horde 1-90 because BotOperator donated the CD key for my Horde account specificly for that purpose
and I am in his debt for that

Thank you,

Botanist
