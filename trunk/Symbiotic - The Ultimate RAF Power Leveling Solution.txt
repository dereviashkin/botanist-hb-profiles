Looting has been added for all levels 10-85. It will [U]require[/U] the Autoequip plugin to be enabled on all the RAF characters at all times.
[INDENT]

[INDENT]
It is [U]not required[/U], but it is suggested that you equip your RAF characters with some bags of your choice to help facilitate looting.

[*]This will allow your characters to acquire some gear before heading into some of the higher level instances inwhich some bosses have instance wide aoe attacks.

[*] There will be two modes of operation:

[INDENT]
[B][U]Full Automation[/U][/B] - User starts the bots (where told) or approximately 5 yrds away from the correct portal entrance, starts all characters from there, and allows the profiles to control everything !!!
[/INDENT]

[INDENT]
[U][B]Instance Automation[/B][/U] - User manually moves all characters approximately 5 yrds away from the correct portal entrance, starts all characters from there. 
[/INDENT]
[INDENT]
