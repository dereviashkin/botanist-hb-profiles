These are the Honorbuddy meshes currently on my computer.
They are up-to-date as of the last time I ran the bot in the zones.
To use these meshes, close Honorbuddy. 
Copy all the files in the HonorbuddyMeshes folder.
Then brose to where your meshes are stored, by default C:\Users\Your User Account Name\AppData\Local\HonorbuddyMeshes
Paste the copied meshes into the HonorbuddyMeshes folder.
***** Note *****
Overwrite any existing meshes you currently have.
Restart Honorbuddy
