[CENTER][COLOR="#696969"][SIZE=4]An "[COLOR="#0000FF"]open[/COLOR]" discussion of the "DON'Ts" of BOTTING WoW[/SIZE][/COLOR]

[CODE]
[LIST]
[*] Tip #1 Don't bot on any account you aren't willing to get banned on !
[/LIST]

[LIST]
[*] Tip #2 HonorBuddy uses mesh files to navigate. A mesh file is an 8 X 8 geometric map tile which tells HB if there are obstacles in its path. 
[INDENT]
The bot should automatically contact the mesh server and download the necessary meshes it needs for a particular zone. 
[/INDENT]
[INDENT]
It will not download all the game meshes at once. Those meshes will then be stored on your pc for future use.
[/INDENT]
[INDENT]
Your mesh collection will grow upwards of 2 gigs over time.
[/INDENT]
[INDENT]
New users of HonorBuddy will start out with no mesh files. 

This means the bot will act erratically until it acquires the necessary files it needs to navigate to its objective.

This includes standing still doing nothing while the bot attempts to download the necessary mesh files.

You should never afk your bot(s) unless you have extensively tested a particular profile/botbase on your computer.
[INDENT]
Even if you are confident the profile/botbase will work correctly, there are still potential risk involved any time you afk the bot.

All post must abide by the forum rules of HonorBuddy and their "Moderators".  Deliberate/unintentional violations of those rules will result in administrative action and possibly result with being banned from the forum.

For those that know me, I personally ask each of you to keep it clean. Comments posted in this thread could be useful to the less experienced users of the bot.

[COLOR="#FF0000"]Personal attacks for ones opinion will not be tolerated[/COLOR]. Acting "the fool" will [COLOR="#FF0000"]not be tolerated[/COLOR]. Excessive cursing or pretty much [B][U][COLOR="#0000CD"]any ridiculous behavior[/COLOR][/U][/B] will [COLOR="#FF0000"]not be tolerated[/COLOR].

[SIZE=3][COLOR="#FF0000"]I will delete the thread if this doesn't work out the way I intend !!![/COLOR][/SIZE][/CENTER]
