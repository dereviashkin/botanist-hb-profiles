[COLOR="#0000CD"][SIZE=4]Tips[/SIZE][/COLOR]

[CODE]
[CENTER]
Tip #1 Don't bot on any account you aren't willing to get banned on !



Tip #2 HonorBuddy uses mesh files to navigate. Take the entire wow map, divide it into 8 X 8 tiles. 

Each tile is a geometric mesh. HB uses the individual mesh files to plot courses and navigate around obstacles. 

The greater the distance between point A and point B, the more mesh files required for HB to plot a course. 
[INDENT]
The bot should automatically contact the mesh server and download the necessary meshes it needs for a particular zone. 
[/INDENT]
[INDENT]
It will not download all the game meshes at once. Those meshes will then be stored on your pc for future use.
[/INDENT]
[INDENT]
Your mesh collection will grow upwards of 2 gigs over time.
[/INDENT]
[INDENT]
New users of HonorBuddy will start out with no mesh files. 

This means the bot will act erratically until it acquires the necessary files it needs to navigate to its objective.

This includes standing still doing nothing while the bot attempts to download the necessary mesh files.

[/INDENT]




Tip #3 You should never afk your bot(s) unless you have extensively tested a particular profile/botbase on your computer.
[INDENT]
Even if you are confident the profile/botbase will work correctly, there are still potential risk involved any time you afk the bot.
[/INDENT]




Tip #4 Any time WoW patches, HonorBuddy will be down.
[INDENT]
The down time will vary from a few hours to a few weeks depending on the patch/Expansion.

Minor changes in the game can lead to major changes in the bot. 

Don't assume you know what you are talking about until you can supply you own bot that is comparable to HB.

Bitching and complaining [B][U]will not[/U][/B] speed up the process, if anything it [B][U]henders[/U][/B] it.

Constantly nagging 3rd party Developers about errors while there is not a stable release of HB is a complete waste of everyone's time, 

and will likely result in you being ignored.

[B][U][SIZE=3]If it won't run for you, wait for a stable release ![/SIZE][/U][/B]

[CODE]
[LIST]
Those having instance locks: 

You can open the Quest Behaviors\Misc\]InstanceTimer.cs file and modify the timer to your liking or replace the line of code in the profile with the line of code below.

Use Notepad ++ to easily open and modify .xml and .cs files

Example [B]13 minutes[/B] =  WaitTime="780000" 

[INDENT]
<CustomBehavior File="Misc\InstanceTimer" Timer="Check" WaitTime="780000" />
[/INDENT]
[/LIST]
[/CODE]






[SIZE=3][COLOR="#0000CD"][UserSettings-v1294(error)] PROFILE ERROR:     UserSettings does not allow access to the 'AdvancedSettingsMode' attribute.
      Please modify the profile to refrain from accessing the 'AdvancedSettingsMode' attribute.[/COLOR][/SIZE]



[CODE]

With the latest "test" releases of HB, it's not reading the Usersettings correctly !

You have to open the profile using notepad ++ and remove the following two lines from the UserSettings: AdvancedSettingsMode and ProfileDebuggingMode 

If the profile has multiple files, you will need to do it in each file

[/CODE]



All post must abide by the forum rules of HonorBuddy and their "Moderators".  Deliberate/unintentional violations of those rules will result in administrative action and possibly result with being banned from the forum.

For those that know me, I personally ask each of you to keep it clean. Comments posted in this thread could be useful to the less experienced users of the bot.

[COLOR="#FF0000"]Personal attacks for ones opinion will not be tolerated[/COLOR]. Acting "the fool" will [COLOR="#FF0000"]not be tolerated[/COLOR]. Excessive cursing or pretty much [B][U][COLOR="#0000CD"]any ridiculous behavior[/COLOR][/U][/B] will [COLOR="#FF0000"]not be tolerated[/COLOR].

[SIZE=3][COLOR="#FF0000"]I will delete the thread if this doesn't work out the way I intend !!![/COLOR][/SIZE][/CENTER]
