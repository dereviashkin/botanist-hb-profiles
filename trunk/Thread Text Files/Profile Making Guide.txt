[CENTER][COLOR=#800080][SIZE=5][B]Botanist "Profile Making" Guide[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]



[COLOR="#000000"]This will be a rather straight forward "noob" guide for all the people needing or wanting specific grind profiles for HB.

An average grind profile take between 5-10 minutes to create and it's very simple to do. 
99% of it is copy and paste & requires no coding experience.

It is not required but I do suggest downloading and installing [URL="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v5.9.6.2.html"][COLOR="#800080"]Notepad ++[/COLOR][/URL] to use as your editor.

To briefly cover some basics, a profile is nothing more than a text file with a .xml file extention. To create a completely blank profile, do the following:

First, you need to make sure "show known file extentions" is turned on by going to control panel\folder options\view - tab at the top\scroll down - make sure "hide extentions for known file types" is unticked\click apply\click OK

Right click the desktop\choose new\text document\rename the document to what you want, make sure the file extention is .xml - when you try to save the file, a popup window will alert "If you change a file name extention, the file might become unstable. Are you sure you want to change it?" click YES

You now have a completely blank .xml profile
Unfortunately it won't do anything at this point, but it soon will.[/COLOR][/CENTER]

[COLOR="#000000"][CENTER]Copy the following code and paste it into the .xml file you just created.[/CENTER][/COLOR]

[COLOR="#000000"][CENTER]Now save the file again.

As you can see the code here is fairly evident. Each task essentially has an opening and closing tag - the first and last line of each task.

Between the opening/closing tags you can enter single/multiple task.
All you need is the information to paste between the tags, which you will obtain from the HB2 Developers Tools Tab which you can get to by ticking the advance options in HB2 and then clicking the Developers Tools button on the bottom right. 

Once opened, move the window from overlapping the HB2 log window.

To get your current coordinates: click the refresh button to the right of "position", your current coordinates will appear, double click the coordinates...now they will appear in the HB2 log window. There you can highlight\copy the information you need and paste it into the proper place in your profile. 

This will be the procedure for all the information you need for your profile

For mob faction ID's, vendor information, target information etc. you will target the mob/npc and then click the copy xml button in the developers tools window. The information will then appear in the HB2 log window to be copied\pasted.

Go to the place you want to grind (where the mobs are) get your coordinates and enter them as hotspots in your profile. You can enter multiple hotspots.

Get the mobs faction ID and enter it into the factions. You can enter multiple factions...seperated by a ,

Get the information for any mobs you want to avoid and enter them as avoidmobs.

Set the information for selling/mailing by entering true/false

There are other options you can edit, most should be very apparent in the profile. Just use a little common sense.

Please note, you do not need all the information you are given, only certain portions.


The finished profile will look similar to this:[/CENTER][/COLOR]

[CENTER][COLOR="#000000"]Once you have all the information pasted into the profile, save it a final time and move it into your collection. You can easily go back and edit the profile later.

I have included a blank profile you can download to avoid having to create your own.

Hopes this helps everyone who keeps requesting simple profiles, that most people won't take the time to make. Not to mention, do you really want to be running profiles identical to everyone else?[/COLOR]


[B][U][COLOR="#FF0000"]I strongly suggest that any and all grinding profiles be used in moderation[/COLOR][/U][/B]

[COLOR="#800080"]Oh, and show a little love by clicking that +rep button, it only takes a few seconds.[/COLOR][/CENTER]
