[B][SIZE=2]Solstice is an [U]alternative[/U] method for farming gold. It uses "Death Knights", level 58 or above to farm instances and vendor all the unprotected items.[/SIZE][/B]
[SIZE=2][B]
Solstice allows users to purchase a new [URL="http://us.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=110000044"]Battle Chest[/URL] account, level 1 character to level 55 (Hunter's level the fastest), then roll (1-49) level 55 Death Knight's as a virtual gold farming army !!![/B][/SIZE]

[B][U][SIZE=2]Say goodbye to GatherBuddy and hello to a new way of gold farming ![/SIZE][/U][/B]

[B][U][SIZE=2]Solstice allows users to setup 1-49 Blood Death Knights farming instances for 2 hours each. With Arelog running 24/7, it takes 96 hours for the cycle to repeat.[/SIZE][/U][/B]

[B][U][SIZE=2]Meaning each Death Knight farms for a grand total of 4 hours per week. That should take care of any so-called LCP detection which they probably can't use in instances to begin with.[/SIZE][/U][/B]

[B][COLOR="#000000"][SIZE=3]Now multiply that by 10 accounts = 490 Death Knights !!![/SIZE][/COLOR][/B]


[B][U][COLOR="#000000"][SIZE=2]These profiles are the result of Blizz banning my first [B][U]non-botting[/U][/B] account 4+ years ago, and then acting like pricks about it. Like I told them then, I would get even.[/SIZE][/COLOR][/U][/B]


[B][U][COLOR="#000000"][SIZE=3][B][U]Revenge[/U][/B] is a dish best served cold !!! [/SIZE][/COLOR][/U][/B]


[B][SIZE=4][COLOR="#FF0000"]***** Warning *****[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]

[CODE]

[CENTER]In most cases, you do not need to clear the entire instance, only enough to last at least 12 minutes. Then you can run out and reset without getting instance locked.

The profile uses [U]Mobile Banking[/U] to deposit [U]all your gold except 100g[/U]. If your toons are in guilds that you don't own, [U]it will deposit all your gold into those guilds[/U]. 

And no, I can't change that. If you wish to do so, you have to change every profile, good luck.[/CENTER]
