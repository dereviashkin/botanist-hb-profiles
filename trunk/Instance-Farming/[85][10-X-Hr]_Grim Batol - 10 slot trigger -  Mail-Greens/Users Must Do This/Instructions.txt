Copy the questbehaviors in this Misc folder and paste them to your Honorbuddy\Questbehaviors\Misc folder

Do NOT replace any files that are already there

Close and restart the bot after copying the questbehaviors

If you do not do this, most of the profiles will not run

You will need to repeat the same procedure each time you do a clean extraction of HonorBuddy
