?On October 27th 2014, Hawker (co-owner) of Honorbuddy messaged me via skype and accused me of allegedly being an accessory to the theft of HonorBuddy Store Products and providing them to CodeDeception

All those that know me know I am not a real coder or hacker. I write .xml; a kindergarten "non" programming language.

?Such an accusation is absolutely ridiculous !!!

As a result of such backstabbing after 5 years of supporting HB, I will no longer support HonorBuddy (as a company). I will continue to update my donor SVN and all the profiles it contains. All new products will be released via my donor SVN, my website or for the new bot, Rebot  whom I intend to start coding profiles for.

R.I.P


Oh and for those that buy products from HonorBuddy, they also took the liberty of banning a 6 session key worth $226 as well as several hundred dollars worth of store products which I purchased. None of which have they reimbursed me for.

As far as I am concerned, HonorBuddy stole $500 + from me. Not that I care about the money I spent. I more than made my money back. It's more the  principle of stabbing a 5 year contributor in the back and stealing from a loyal customer.

Excellent business model.

Note To HonorBuddy : I have 12 other legit HonorBuddy Keys and the Codedeception patcher. Stealing my key was a dumb ass move.


Concidering HonorBuddy's servers have been hacked numerous times and users keys & personal information was compromised. Viruses have been up loaded to their auth server. They need to clean up their own house and disclose that information to their user base. They showed no concern for their users when their server databases were hacked and the entire database stolen. In fact they never mentioned anything about it to their users .

Truth of the matter is that all user keys were hacked 3-4 months ago. I was informed that the databases had been hacked. I in turn told Bambam922 ( I even provided Bambam922 with his home address to prove the database had been hacked), who then told Bossland, who then swept it under the rug.


?And yes Bossland, I do have all the chat logs.

Oh one other thing, you need to quit violating the German courts ruling and selling HonorBuddy under the WOWBOT.AT name in Germany.
